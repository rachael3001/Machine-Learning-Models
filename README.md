# Classification Models
 Work showcasing my classification skills:
 
 Marital Status 
  I began predicting Marital status in a HR analytics dataset. I used random forest regression and before tuning I got 64% and after tuning I got 65% accuracy. After increasing size of training data my score went to 69%. I also tried KNN model where accuracy was worse.

Department
  I then tried to predict the job role of an individual, again beginning with randomForest where I got accuracy of 0.55. I tried gradient boosting where I got a much better 0.65 before tuning.
